* Machine Learning can be unpredictable and opaque.
* Deep Learning can be vulnerable to hacking.
* Machine Learning requires tons of clean training data.
* Deep Learning and GPUs break a lot of assumptions.
* Machine Learning can look at far more data than humans.
* The combination of humans and computers is powerful.
* **What's coming?**
  * Better tools and platforms.
  * More medical applications.
  * New solutions to training data.
* How to \(**successfully**\) ship deep learning projects:
  * Pay a lot of attention to your training data.
  * Get something working end-to-end right away, then improve one thing at a time.
  * Look for graceful ways to handle the inevitable cases where the algorithm fails.
