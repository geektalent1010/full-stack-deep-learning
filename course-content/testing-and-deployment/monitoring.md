## Summary

* It is crucial to monitor serving systems, training pipelines, and input data. A typical monitoring system can **raise alarms** when things go wrong and provide the records for tuning things.
* Cloud providers have decent monitoring solutions.
* Anything that can be logged can be monitored: dependency changes, distribution shift in data, model instabilities, etc.
* **Data distribution monitoring** is an underserved need!
* It is important to monitor the **business uses** of the model, not just its statistics. Furthermore, it is important to be able to **contribute failures** back to the dataset.
