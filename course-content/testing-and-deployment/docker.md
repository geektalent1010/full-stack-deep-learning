## Summary

* Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization, also known as **containerization**.
* A container is a standardized unit of fully packaged software used for local development, shipping code, and deploying system.
* Though Docker presents on how to deal with each of the individual microservices, we also need an orchestrator to handle the whole cluster of services. For that, **Kubernetes** is the open-source winner, and it has excellent support from the leading cloud vendors.
