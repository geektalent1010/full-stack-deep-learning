## Summary

* [ML Test Score :  A Rubric for Production Readiness and Technical Debt Reduction](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/aad9f93b86b7addfea4c419b9100c6cdd26cacea.pdf)  is an exhaustive framework/checklist from practitioners at Google.
* The paper presents a rubric as a set of 28 actionable tests and offers a scoring system to measure how ready for production a given machine learning system is. These are categorized into 4 sections: \(1\) data tests, \(2\) model tests, \(3\) ML infrastructure tests, and \(4\) monitoring tests.
* The scoring system provides a vector for incentivizing ML system developers to achieve stable levels of reliability by providing a clear indicator of readiness and clear guidelines for how to improve.
