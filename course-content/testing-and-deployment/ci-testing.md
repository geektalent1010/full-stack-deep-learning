## Summary

* **Unit tests** are designed for specific module functionality.
* **Integration tests** are designed for the whole system.
* **Continuous integration** is an environment where tests are run every time a new code is pushed to the repository before the updated model is deployed.
* A quick survey of continuous integration tools yields several options: CircleCI, Travis CI, Jenkins, and Buildkite.
