## Summary

* The “All-In-One” machine learning platforms provide a single system for everything: developing models, scaling experiments to many machines, tracking experiments and versioning models, deploying models, and monitoring model performance.
* **FBLearner Flow** is the workflow management platform at the heart of the Facebook ML engineering ecosystem.
* **Michelangelo**, Uber’s ML Platform, supports the training and serving of thousands of models in production across the company.
* **TensorFlow Extended** \(TFX\) is a Google-production-scale ML platform based on TensorFlow.
* Another option from Google is its **Cloud AI Platform**, a managed service that enables you to easily build machine learning models, that work on any type of data, of any size.
* **Amazon SageMaker** is one of the core AI offerings from AWS that helps teams through all stages in the machine learning life cycle.
* **Neptune** is a product that focuses on managing the experimentation process while remaining lightweight and easy to use by any data science team.
* **FloydHub** is another managed cloud platform for data scientists.
* **Paperspace** provides a solution for accessing computing power via the cloud and offers it through an easy-to-use console where everyday consumers can just click a button to log into their upgraded, more powerful remote machine.
* **Determined AI** is a startup that creates software to handle everything from managing cluster compute resources to automating workflows, thereby putting some of that big-company technology within reach of any organization.
* **Domino Data Lab** is an integrated end-to-end platform that is language agnostic, having a rich functionality for version control and collaboration; as well as one-click infrastructure scalability, deployment, and publishing.
