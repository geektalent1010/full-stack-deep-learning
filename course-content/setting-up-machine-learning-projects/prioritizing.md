* The project should have **high impact,** where cheap prediction is valuable for the complex parts of your business process.
* The project should have **high feasibility,** which is driven by the data availability, accuracy requirements, and problem difficulty.
* Here are 3 types of hard machine learning problems:
  * \(1\) The output is complex.
  * \(2\) Reliability is required.
  * \(3\) Generalization is expected.
