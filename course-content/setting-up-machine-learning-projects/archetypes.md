* Archetype 1 - Projects that **improve an existing process**: improving route optimization in a ride-sharing service, building a customized churn prevention model, building a better video game AI.
* Archetype 2 - Projects that **augment a manual process**: turning mockup designs into application UI, building a sentence auto-completion feature, helping a doctor to do his/her job more efficient.
* Archetype 3 - Projects that **automate a manual process**: developing autonomous vehicles, automating customer service, automating website design.
* **Data flywheels** is a concept saying that more users lead to more data, more data lead to better models, and better models lead to more users.
