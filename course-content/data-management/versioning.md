## Summary

* Data versioning refers to saving new copies of your data when you make changes so that you can go back and retrieve specific versions of your files later.
* In **Level 0**, the data lives on the filesystem and/or object storage and the database without being versioned.
* In **Level 1**, the data is versioned by storing a snapshot of everything at training time.
* In **Level 2**, the data is versioned as a mix of assets and code.
* **Level 3** requires specialized solutions for versioning data. You should avoid these until you can fully explain how they will improve your project.
