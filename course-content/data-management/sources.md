## Summary

* Most deep learning applications require lots of labeled data. There are publicly available datasets that can serve as a starting point, but there is no competitive advantage of doing so.
* Most companies usually spend a lot of money and time to label their own data.
* **Data flywheel** means harnessing the power of users rapidly improve the whole machine learning system.
* **Semi-supervised learning** is a relatively recent learning technique where the training data is autonomously \(or automatically\) labeled.
* **Data augmentation** is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of data available for training models, without actually collecting new data.
* **Synthetic data** is data thatâ€™s generated programmatically, an underrated idea that is almost always worth starting with.
